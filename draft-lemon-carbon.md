--- abstract

This document explores the question of whether or not the IETF should meet in person
three times every year, and what the benefits might be of deciding to do something
different.

# Introduction

The IETF hosts an in-person meeting three times per year.   In-person meetings are traditional,
but more than that they are considered very beneficial because of the informal discussions, some
planned but many unplanned, that occur during IETF meetings.   There is clear benefit to meeting
in person.   But there is also clear cost.   This document attempts to explore not only the cost
of meeting in person, but also the opportunities that might be available if we were to seriously
consider not doing so.

# Benefits of meeting in person

There are a number of benefits to meeting in person, a few of which are enumerated here:

* IETF meetings have a particular culture, which isn't easily appreciated by IETF participants
  who only join in on mailing lists.   Attending meetings in person gives IETF attendees a
  rapid entry into the IETF culture.
* Meeting in person allows for rapid progress when interested participants come prepared and
  engage face to face.
* Because no schedule is perfect, IETF attendees often visit working groups in which they
  are not regular participants, and gain a broader view of the work of the IETF than they
  would have if they remained in their particular silo.
* IETF in-person registration fees are the IETF's only real source of non-donation income.

# Problems with meeting in person

* Quite frequently, IETF in-person meetings do not live up to the standard described here.
  Rather than engaging in discussion and making progress, meetings can tend to be places where
  a dozen slide decks are presented, and little discussion occurs.

* Meeting in person is quite expensive, both in terms of money and in terms of carbon footprint.
  The expected attendance at IETF in Bangkok is over a thousand; a back-of-the-envelope calculation
  suggests that this will produce over a thousand metric tons of carbon emission.

* Meeting in person privileges those who can afford to fly, or whose companies can afford to fly
  them.

* Although there is a certain cadre of IETF participants who are able to easily arrange to
  attend IETF meeting after IETF meeting, for many potential IETF participants, there is no way
  to justify the cost, and so even though they are interested, they have to attend online or not
  at all.

* Because online attendance is not the focus of in-person IETF meetings, online attendees 
  have a much harder time participating; technical problems abound, audio often just doesn't work,
  and the meeting goes on anyway, because the remote participants are not visible, and there are
  people in the room.

* Because in-person meetings are so expensive, it's often the case that half the active,
  interested participants in a working group show up, and the other half don't.  This severely
  handicaps the discussions that can be had; ostensibly the idea of coming to IETF in person is
  to have productive in-person discussions, but if half the participants aren't there, this
  doesn't actually happen.

* Scheduling at IETF is highly problematic.   This IETF, there was one slot where four working
  groups that I would describe as strongly desirable to attend meet.   This too can hamper
  discussion--if I fly all the way to Bangkok and then can't go to meetings I need to go to,
  what good is that?

# Opportunities

The IETF is the organization that is most central to the development of the protocols with which
the Internet operates.   By meeting in person three times a year, we are failing to eat our own
dogfood.   If we can't successfully do our work over the Internet, what does that say about us
as an organization?   Isn't that a failure?

Right now, the IETF has the opportunity to make a real difference in the world.  The IETF's
in-person meeting problem is not unique to the IETF.  There are organizations that manage, out
of necessity, to meet online, but the user experience is not the same as an in-person meeting.
But more importantly, there are many organizations that have a similar carbon footprint to the
IETF.

The IETF could make it a first-class goal to make in-person meetings less necessary, not only
for the IETF but for organizations that do similar work.   If we were to succeed in this, we
not only have the potential to become more effective and to reduce our own carbon footprint,
but we could serve as an example for similar organizations, potentially multiplying our savings
tens or even hundreds of times as our work gains foothold elsewhere.

# Intermediate goals

Right now, IETF remote attendance isn't good enough to reduce the choice of whether or not to
go to IETF to one of convenience.   It is definitely better to attend in person.   What would
we have to change in order to affect this?   Are there changes that would be required in the
handling of queueing for discussions?

Is there a way to do something about the interminable slideware meetings?   Can we change this
culture?   What do we have to to do get to where we are having engaged discussions instead of
presentations?

# Challenges

The IETF's finances depend on in-person meetings.   It's often said that if we met online,
nobody would be willing to pay the conference fee.   Is this really true?   It seems unlikely.
It would be interesting to see if we could collect some real data on this.

If the IETF were to replace one of its in-person meetings with an online meeting, would people
take it seriously, or would they just skip that one?

It's also often said that IETF attendees will not actually be able to get a week free of work
obligations if they aren't traveling.  So if the meeting is held online, they won't attend
because they'll be pulled back into day-to-day work events.   Is this really true?   If it is
true, what does that say about the value of the IETF to these participants' employers?

In practice, the Internet isn't really able to support online meetings with great reliability.
It's close--people do have fifty-person meetings on Zoom, which is a commercial product, and get
real work done in those meetings.  But Zoom sometimes doesn't work through corporate firewalls.
Other tools have similar issues, in addition in some cases to severe performance issues.

If we were going to hold an IETF meeting online, we would need to better characterize the kinds
of problems that happen.   We would need plans for how to rapidly address problems so that they
do not disrupt meetings.   We would need onboarding methodologies so that problems that might
crop up in meetings are diagnosed and fixed early.

# Proposal

The IETF has been talking about this problem for years.  People keep coming up to the mic at the
plenary and raising this idea, and it keeps getting shouted down.  In order for us to make
progress on this, we need to actually decide to do it.  IETFs 109 and 110 currently have no
announced meeting site.  I'm sure work is ongoing to identify one, but presumably no paperwork
has been signed yet.  Let's pick one of those two IETFs to be our experiment, and get started
now preparing to hold an online IETF meeting.

# Security Considerations

Meeting online reduces the risk of Visa issues, but could run afoul of national firewalls in some
cases.   This would be one of the potential issues that we would need to research while planning
an online IETF meeting
